HomeScanner
--------------------
This is a DIY medium-resolution scanner using Python and
OpenCV with a Logitech HD webcam taped to a box. It does 
the good work of scanning images into jpeg files rapidly
upon the "w" keypress, and then `pdf.sh` can be used to
combine everything into a pdf in scanned order. Note 
that the python img2pdf program is required for pdf.sh
to work. For more information on usage, please refer to
the source code.
